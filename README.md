# OpenBaybayin

OpenBaybayin is a font primarily made to accompany my Unicode proposal, *The baybayin “ra”—ᜍ: its origins and a plea for its formal recognition*.

Note: Font is based somewhat on Noto Sans Tagalog. "All Noto fonts are published under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1." per https://www.google.com/get/noto/ , this font is under the same license.
